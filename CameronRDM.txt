Hello, I am looking forward to learning a lot in this class. I have some fun ideas
for web services and hope that after this class I will be able to make them.

I hope to make something of a Reddit clone. There will be users that can create
different channels/forums, and make posts on the forums. Users will also be able to comment
So in total there will be four entities, Users, Channels, Posts, and Comments
